## Hybrid LED & Stepper Motor Clock

### Hardware Description

* **Main Controller**: Arduino Nano with 5V/2A power supply
* **Real-Time Clock**: DS3231 RTC Module connected via I2C on pins A4 and A5
* **Stepper Motor**: 28BYJ-48 with ULN2003 driver connected on pins A0, A1, A2 and A3
* **LED Rings**: 
  - 24-LED NeoPixel ring (outer, hour display)
  - 12-LED NeoPixel ring (inner, background effects)
  - Both connected to pin 6 (24-LED ring addressed first: 0-23, 12-LED ring: 24-35)
* **Position Sensor**: A3144 Hall Effect sensor connected to pin 2, active LOW
* **Enclosure**: Custom 3D-printed housing with clear acrylic face

### Function Description

**Core Timekeeping**
- Precision RTC maintains accurate time even when powered off
- 12-hour display mode with intelligent AM/PM handling
- Automatic daylight saving time support (configurable)

**Analog Display (Stepper Motor)**
- High-precision minute hand positioning using 2048-step motor
- Intelligent calibration system using Hall effect sensor
- Smooth movement algorithms prevent jerky motion
- Power-saving: motor only energized during movement
- Automatic recalibration at midnight for long-term accuracy

**Digital Display (LED Rings)**
- **24-LED Outer Ring**: Hour display with LED #0 at 12 o'clock position
  - Current hour and all previous hours illuminated in white
  - Unused positions show dynamic background colors
  - Special animations for hour changes
- **12-LED Inner Ring**: Background effects and status indication
  - Complementary color patterns for aesthetic appeal
  - Temperature-based coloring (when sensor connected)
  - Status indicators for calibration and system health

**Advanced Display Modes**
- **Normal Time**: Standard time display with color cycling
- **Rainbow Mode**: Full spectrum color animation
- **Temperature Mode**: Color-coded temperature visualization
- **Date Mode**: Month/day representation using LED positions
- **Calibration Mode**: Diagnostic display for setup and maintenance
